# Angular Theme

Kept you waiting huh?

## Intro

I made this theme for my arcade cabinet, mainly because I got permission to bring it in to school to celebrate the last week. So I wanted to do something special for it.

## The Theme

In case you couldn't tell, this is called the "Angular" theme. Why? The whole motif is the slanted colored bar that acts as the background for the text.
